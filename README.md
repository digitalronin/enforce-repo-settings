# Enforce Repository Settings

Given a reference to a github repository, enforce a standard set of permissions
and other settings.

## Pre-requisites

A `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable whose value is a GitHub [personal access
token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with at least `repo` scope, and
SSO-enabled if appropriate.
